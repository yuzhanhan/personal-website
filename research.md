##### Does Air Pollution Impair Work Safety? The Impact of PM2.5 on Severe Workplace Injuries

##### Monopsony in Academia and the Gender Pay Gap: Evidence from California. *(with Alfonso Flores-Lagunes)*  
We investigate the existence of monopsony power in a highly-skilled labor market given by tenure-ranked faculty in public research universities in California, analyze differences in monopsony power by gender, and relate them to the observed gender pay gap.

	 We collect and use publicly-available information of faculty salaries in the University of California system and merge it with information obtained online on faculty characteristics, career trajectories, and research productivity indicators. We infer the university-level labor supply elasticity by estimating the elasticity of separation. To deal with the endogeneity of the salary in the separation equation, we employ instrumental variables exploiting exogenous variation in salaries driven by changes in school revenues and salary scales. We find evidence of monopsony power: the "exploitation rate", a common measure of monopsony power, is conservatively estimated at about 7% for tenure-track faculty. Full professors experience a higher rate of monopsony power than associate and assistant professors. Lastly, while the estimated monopsony power is not found to differ by gender for assistant and associate professors, it does so for full professors, with women facing a higher exploitation rate relative to males.
