#### [Does Air Pollution Impair Work Safety? The Impact of PM2.5 on Severe Workplace Injuries](https://yuzhanhan.github.io/Job-Market/Papers/JMP_ZhanhanYu.pdf) (Job Market Paper)  
I investigate the causal effect of air pollution on workplace safety using novel data on work-related severe injuries and PM2.5 pollution in the United States from 2015 through 2018. I focus on fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, a primary air pollutant found to adversely impact human cognitive abilities and potentially affect workplace safety via biological channels. Credibly pinning down the causal effect of air pollution is challenging because air pollutants are not randomly assigned across space or workplaces. To deal with the endogeneity of air pollution, I employ a quasi-experimental design, exploiting exogenous variation in PM2.5 driven by two different instruments — rainfall and wind direction. I start by testing the validity of these instruments and show that they violate the assumptions for point identification of interest. Then, I leverage partial identification strategies using the same instruments to estimate bounds on the effect of air pollution. The estimated bounds on the effect of PM2.5 pollution suggest that air pollution increases the workplace accident rate by between 7 and 39% relative to the sample average accident rate. The effect appears to be more prominent for industries that require outdoor work, such as agriculture, mining, and construction, than non-manufacturing indoor industries. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that increasing the annual number of days with PM2.5 pollution by two days is estimated to raise annual total costs of workers’ compensation by at least 0.9 billion dollars and up to 5.1 billion, equivalent to about 1 to 8% of total workers’ compensation paid in 2018.

#### [Monopsony in Academia and the Gender Pay Gap: Evidence from California](https://yuzhanhan.github.io/Job-Market/Papers/Monopsony_in_Academia.pdf) *(with [Alfonso Flores-Lagunes](https://aflores-lagunes.weebly.com))*  
We investigate the existence of monopsony power in a highly-skilled labor market given by tenure-ranked faculty in public research universities in California, analyze differences in monopsony power by gender, and relate them to the observed gender pay gap.   
<details>
	<summary>More</summary>
	 We collect and use publicly-available information of faculty salaries in the University of California system and merge it with information obtained online on faculty characteristics, career trajectories, and research productivity indicators. We infer the university-level labor supply elasticity by estimating the elasticity of separation. To deal with the endogeneity of the salary in the separation equation, we employ instrumental variables exploiting exogenous variation in salaries driven by changes in school revenues and salary scales. We find evidence of monopsony power: the "exploitation rate", a common measure of monopsony power, is conservatively estimated at about 7% for tenure-track faculty. Full professors experience a higher rate of monopsony power than associate and assistant professors. Lastly, while the estimated monopsony power is not found to differ by gender for assistant and associate professors, it does so for full professors, with women facing a higher exploitation rate relative to males.

#### Heat and Productivity: Evidence From On-Time Performance of Airlines *(with [Ying Shi](https://sites.google.com/site/yingandshi/home))*  

<details>
	<summary>More</summary>
	 We study the impact of high temperatures on worker productivity in transportation and logistics industries by examining flight on-time performance on hotter days. We create a novel data set linking the on-time performance data of flights departing from 365 airports in the contiguous United States from 2004 through 2019 with daily meteorological data. We find statistically significant evidence that operating on hotter days increases both flight delays and delay time. On days above 95F (35C), flights are 6% more likely to experience late departure, and 17% longer time of delay conditional on late departure. We conjecture that the impact of heat on flight delays may be driven by either labor shortage associated with changes in the intertemporal labor supply of workers with temperature (the extensive margin) or an absolute decline in worker performance on hotter days (the intensive margin). We examine the extensive margin channel using the 2005-2019 American Time-Use Survey (ATUS) and find evidence to support our conjecture that high temperatures affect flight on-time performance in part through the labor supply channel. In industries that typically require workers to perform tasks in outdoor environments, workers work about 30 minutes less on days above 95F (35C). More importantly, we find a significant absenteeism effect of high temperatures. One additional day above 95F in the past week increases absenteeism among outdoor workers by 8% relative to the average absenteeism rate).

#### The Effect of Tax Levies on Future Construction and Demolitions: The Importance of Zeros When Leveraging Voting Designs *(with [David Brasington](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/economics/faculty/david-brasington.html) and [Alfonso Flores-Lagunes](https://aflores-lagunes.weebly.com))*  
<details>
	<summary>More</summary>
	 We investigate the effects of tax levies on future construction and demolitions. To estimate the effects, we leverage the voting that has taken place when a local government considers imposing the tax levies in a regression discontinuity design. Importantly we show that the results change dramatically based on whether one takes into account the incidence on zeros — localities where no construction or demolition took place — at the voting threshold. Furthermore, statistically accounting for those zeroes allows to disentangle two distinct effects that tax levies have: on the probability of observing non-zero construction or demolition, and on their conditional amount. Our results indicate that tax levies positively affect the amount of new construction. Estimates that do not account for the presence of zeros in the outcomes often have the opposite sign and are sometimes statistically significant.
