Welcome! My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor, health, and environmental economics, focusing on topics related to worker productivity, health at work, climate change, and environmental justice. 

I have additional interests in education/urban policy and applied econometrics. See the [Research](./research) page for more information on my ongoing projects.
