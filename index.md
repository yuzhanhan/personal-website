Welcome! I am an Adam Smith Career Development Fellow at the Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow. My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor and environmental economics. I have additional interests in education/urban policy and applied econometrics. See the [Research](./research) page for more information on my ongoing projects.



I will be on the 2024-2025 job market. My CV is available [here](https://yuzhanhan.github.io/Research-Git/CV_ZhanhanYu.pdf).
