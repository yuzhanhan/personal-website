Hi! Welcome to Zhanhan Yu ('zan-'han-'u)'s website! I am a Ph.D Candidate in Economics at Syracuse University. My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor and environmental economics, with a focus on measuring and understanding the effect of environmental factors, e.g., air pollution and heat, on labor market outcomes such as work safety and worker productivity.

I have additional interests in applied micro and urban economics. See the [Research](./research) page for more information on my ongoing projects.  

I am available for interview at the ASSA meetings in January.

Feel free to contact me at: zyu127[at]syr[dot]edu. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixva641c1icv48e/CV_ZhanhanYu.pdf?dl=0).
