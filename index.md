Welcome! I am a Ph.D Candidate in Economics at Syracuse University. My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor and environmental economics, focusing on topics in worker productivity, climate change, and environmental justice. 

I have additional interests in applied econometrics and urban economics. See my [Google site](https://sites.google.com/view/zhanhanyu) for more information on my ongoing projects and teaching experience.

Feel free to contact me at: zyu127[at]syr[dot]edu. You can find my CV [here](https://yuzhanhan.github.io/Job-Market/CV_ZhanhanYu.pdf).
