Welcome! My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor and environmental economics. I have additional interests in education/urban policy and applied econometrics. See the [Research](./research) page for more information on my ongoing projects.


I will be on the 2024-2025 job market. Please feel free to contact me at: zhanhan[dot]yu[at]glasgow[dot]ac[dot]uk. You can find my CV [here](https://yuzhanhan.github.io/Research-Git/CV_ZhanhanYu.pdf).
