Welcome! My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of labor, environmental, and health economics, focusing on topics related to how the environment affects labor productivity and health at work.   
&nbsp;

I have additional interests in education/urban policy and applied econometrics. See the [Research](./research) page for more information on my ongoing projects.
